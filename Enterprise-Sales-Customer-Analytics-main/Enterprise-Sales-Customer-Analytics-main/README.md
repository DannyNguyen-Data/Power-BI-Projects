Enterprise Sales & Customer Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Business Problem
Sales and marketing teams often lack a clear, data-driven view of:
- Which customer segments drive the majority of revenue
- Which customers are at risk of churn
- Where cross-sell opportunities exist and how to prioritise them

This project addresses how enterprise teams can use customer and sales data
to improve revenue focus, retention, and basket size.

## 🛠 What I Did
- Designed an end-to-end enterprise BI dashboard using Power BI
- Built an executive reporting layer for high-level performance monitoring
- Applied RFM segmentation to classify customers by value and behaviour
- Developed rule-based cross-sell analysis to identify product bundling opportunities
- Created business-focused KPIs to quantify revenue concentration and uplift potential

## 📈 Key Business Insights
-	Top 20% of customers generate 61% of total revenue, driven primarily by Champions, Loyal, and Potential Loyalist segments.
-	49% of customers contribute 80.61% of revenue, concentrated in Champions, Loyal, and At Risk segments, indicating strong revenue dependency on a limited customer base.
-	At Risk customers alone contribute over 21% of total revenue, highlighting the need for immediate retention actions to prevent revenue loss.
-	Potential Loyalist customers represent a large customer base but contribute only 1.68% of revenue, supporting a selective, low-cost engagement strategy rather than aggressive investment.
-	Cross-sell adoption remains moderate, with an average of 3.35 items per order and 46.82% of orders containing multiple products, indicating clear headroom for growth.
-	46.82% of orders present valid cross-sell opportunities, yet only a subset converts, resulting in an estimated unrealised revenue opportunity of $166.70K.

## 💡 Business Recommendations
- Immediate retention for At Risk and Cannot Lose Them segments, protecting over 21% of revenue, with targeted interventions such as limited-time discounts and personalised outreach.

- Maximise revenue from top segments (Champions, Loyal, Potential Loyalist):

  Champions → upsell premium bundles / VIP offers

  Loyal → subscription or repeat purchase incentives

  Potential Loyalist → low-cost cross-sell / product discovery

- Selective, low-cost engagement for low-contributing segments (Potential Loyal, New, Need Attention, About To Sleep) to optimise ROI.

- Enhance cross-sell execution:

  46.82% of orders show cross-sell potential, current adoption moderate (3.35 items/order)

  Close gap to realise estimated $166.7K incremental revenue by focusing on high-confidence product bundles.
